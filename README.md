Image Equalization and contrast stretching are 2 techniques to enhance image 
  -  lets take about Image Equalization steps
      - get the frequanc array of grey levels (number of repeating of each grey level)
      - calculate probof each one
      - calculate comulative proberty of redundancy of each grey level
      - multibly comulative prob coressponded to each grey level with uper range value
  - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  -second contrust stretching ->inhance image by increase the diffrence between each pixle and other nearst pixels
